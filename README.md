# Invoice Data Extractor using OCR 

This project is a full-stack **OCR-based Invoice Data Extraction tool** built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. It allows you to upload invoice images or PDFs and automatically extract:  

- Invoice Number & Date  
- All line items (Description, Quantity, Unit, Net Price, Net Worth, VAT %, Gross Total)  

It works robustly even when invoices have irregular layouts or merged lines, thanks to custom text normalization and a **pattern-based parser**.

## Demo
ðŸ‘‰ Upload any invoice image (JPG/PNG) or PDF in the app UI.  
The extracted data will be displayed in a table and can be downloaded as a JSON file.
